```javascript
// Enhanced template with dynamic variables
{
  "name": "E-commerce Weekly Newsletter",
  "category": "product",
  "description": "Weekly product updates with featured items and offers",
  "blocks_config": {
    "blocks": [
      {
        "type": "hero",
        "title": "{{season}} Collection",
        "subtitle": "New arrivals for {{customer_segment}}",

}
```

### Advanced Subscriber Segmentation

Create sophisticated subscriber segments:

```sql
-- High engagement B2B subscribers interested in product updates
SELECT s.* FROM subscribers s 
WHERE s.engagement_score > 75 
AND s.status = 'active'
AND 'product' = ANY(s.subscription_preferences)
AND s.company IS NOT NULL
AND s.job_title LIKE '%manager%'
ORDER BY s.engagement_score DESC;

-- Recent subscribers with specific interests
SELECT s.* FROM subscribers s
WHERE s.subscribed_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
AND ('company' = ANY(s.subscription_preferences) OR 'weekly' = ANY(s.subscription_preferences))
AND s.custom_fields->>'industry' = 'technology';
```

### Enhanced Analytics Queries

Track advanced performance metrics:

```sql
-- Performance by newsletter category and template
SELECT 
  n.category,
  nt.name as template_name,
  AVG(ns.open_rate) as avg_open_rate,
  AVG(ns.click_rate) as avg_click_rate,
  COUNT(*) as total_sends,
  AVG(ns.delivery_rate) as avg_delivery_rate
FROM newsletters n
LEFT JOIN newsletter_templates nt ON n.template_id = nt.id
JOIN newsletter_sends ns ON n.id = ns.newsletter_id
WHERE ns.status = 'sent'
  AND ns.sent_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY n.category, nt.id, nt.name
ORDER BY avg_open_rate DESC;

-- A/B testing results analysis
SELECT 
  n.title,
  n.subject_line as version_a_subject,
  n.ab_test_subject_b as version_b_subject,
  AVG(CASE WHEN ns.send_type = 'ab_test_a' THEN ns.open_rate END) as version_a_open_rate,
  AVG(CASE WHEN ns.send_type = 'ab_test_b' THEN ns.open_rate END) as version_b_open_rate,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN ns.send_type = 'ab_test_a' THEN 1 END) as version_a_sends,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN ns.send_type = 'ab_test_b' THEN 1 END) as version_b_sends
FROM newsletters n
JOIN newsletter_sends ns ON n.id = ns.newsletter_id
WHERE n.is_ab_test = true
  AND ns.status = 'sent'
GROUP BY n.id, n.title, n.subject_line, n.ab_test_subject_b;
